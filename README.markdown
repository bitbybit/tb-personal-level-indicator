Personal Level Indicators for Mozilla Thunderbird
=================================================

This add-on brings GMail's "personal level indicators" feature to Thunderbird. It displays little arrows next the emails subjects so you can tell if a message was addressed to you, a group, or a mailing list. A single arrow (›) indicates that a message is sent to you, and a group of others. A double arrow (») appears when the message is sent only to you. Arrows won't appear next to messages sent to a mailing list.

The add-on provides a new column "Personal Level Indicator" that can be enabled via the message list's column chooser.
